## The Psychology Behind Your Wallet

We don't always make logical decisions with our money. Ever bought something you didn’t need just because it was “on sale”? That’s **cognitive bias** at work.

### Key Psychological Biases in Finance

- **Loss Aversion**: We fear losses more than we value gains. ([Learn More](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/loss-aversion/))
- **Overconfidence Bias**: We overestimate our knowledge and predictive ability.
- **Herd Behavior**: We tend to follow the crowd, especially during market highs or crashes.
- **Mental Accounting**: We treat money differently depending on its source or intended use.
